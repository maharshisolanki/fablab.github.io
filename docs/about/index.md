Hi! I am Dhruv Thakker. I am an Interior Designer based in Ahmedabad, India freelancing in Ahmedabad along with Fab Academy 2019. As a graduate of CEPT University,
I have a keen interest in Project management, Space planning, Interior and furniture detailing and Computer Aided Design. 
With Fab Academy, I am looking forward to take the next step in my career by exploring about how the future of Interior Design might look like where there is less space and more functions.

My other interests include Photography, Lawn Tennis, Cricket and Travelling.
