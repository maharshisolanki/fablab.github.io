# 02. Project Management

Being from a design background, I've never had any interaction with the thing called 'version control'. Hence, this week has been really challenging for me.

After logging in my git account on fabcloud, I felt like I had entered an alien world!
I started taking online tutorials to learn git, html and markdown.
- [Markdown tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/)
- [Git for beginners](https://thenewstack.io/tutorial-git-for-absolutely-everyone/)
- [Git tutorials](https://guides.github.com/)
- [Using the Command Line](https://www.computervillage.org/articles/CommandLine.pdf)
- [Git cheat sheet](http://fabacademy.org/2019/docs/FabAcademy-Tutorials/week01_principles_practices_project_management/git_simple.html)
 
Out of the many tutorials I went through, the above are the ones that really helped me(a beginner).

There are two ways to edit you GitLab website. 

### Offline method.

Since offline method is the more preferred method, I started working on my website by setting up git for offline use.

1. Install - [Gitbash](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

2. Next is SSH key generation  
SSH  (Secure Socket Shell), is a network protocol that provides administrators with a secure way to access a remote computer. This step is to link your computer to the server.  
    * For that, we'll need to run the command *ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"* on Gitbash
    * Note: Keep the location and passkey blank
    * Your SSH key will be created and saved.

3. Next is copying this SSH key, to your Gitlab accoount.  
For that, you have to run cat *~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub* in gitlab

Once, you run this, a code will be generated ending with your e-mail id.  
4. Copy this code in your GitLab account in Settings>SSH Keys

After doing this, user will receive an e-mail from GitLab about the same.

To make sure if your computer can access your Gitlab account, run the *ssh -T git@gitlab.com* command
5. Now, to set up a local repository, you need to pull your directory from Gitlab using *git pull "your_repo_link"*
Note: your repo link is available on your GitLab account.

Once this is done, Git is all set on your local computer. Have a look at the [Git cheat sheet](http://fabacademy.org/2019/docs/FabAcademy-Tutorials/week01_principles_practices_project_management/git_simple.html) to learn how to use the same.

After doing this, you can use 'Visual Studio Code' to edit your website using markdown language.

### Online Method

In this method, you can use the edit button on your GitLab website. The language used here is the same markdown language.

An example of a code written on Gitlab is shown below. After writing the code, all you have to do is press on commit changes button at the  bottom and the
changes will be reflected in the website in about a couple of minutes.

If there was an error, you'll get an e-mail regarding the same and you can check for details in the Pipelines option in Cl/CD menu.

Since this seemed simpler to understand for a beginner, I worked using this online method for this week.

But, now I realised the reason why I was advised to use the **offline method**.

### Why offline method is preferred

1. The workflow of softwares such as Visual Studio Code is much faster than the online editor.
2. One needs to upload Images one at a time in the online method. In offline method, multiple images can be can be selected and added.
3. Visual Studio code allows user to handle multiple files at a time. While with online editor, user needs to commit to chnages in one file before starting work on another.
4. There are extensions available in Visual Studio Code to see live previews. There is no such option in the online method.

Hence, I'll be working using the offline method from the hereforth.
