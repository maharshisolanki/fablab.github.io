# 03. Computer Aided design

Being an Interior designer, I've been using softwares like Adobe Photoshop, Indesign, AutoCAD 2d and 3d, Sketchup for the past few years.  
Hence I decided to explore softwares that I have never used in the past.

For 2d raster, I chose **GIMP**, **Inkscape** for 2d vector, **Onshape** and **Fusion 360** for 3d, and **Blender** for Rendering. Also, I've used Grasshopper for Rhino on a couple of occasions before and thus I also chose **antimony** which has a similar interface to grasshopper.

## Installation

I started the week by first downloading the above softwares which I didn't face any issue with except Antimony. I discovered that Antimony works only with Linux and Mac!

But I was keen on exploring Antimony, hence I installed Linux subsystem on my Windows 10(which was much simpler than I expected). But the software still failed to run. So, I tried installing a VirtualBox and then installing Linux in that Virtual Box.
After hours of hair pulling(and a little help from a fellow FabAcademy Student, Samuel Hoque), I was finally able get it up and running. 

Here is a helpful [link](https://github.com/mkeeter/antimony/blob/develop/BUILDING.md) to install antimony

## Fusion 360

As a designer, I've heard about how good and flexible Fusion 360 can be and hence I was really excited to explore that. So that is where I started.

I started looking at online videos about the basics of the software and how it is different from the other CAD softwares that I've been using in the past.

<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/fusion%20360%201.PNG" alt="fusion" width="800px">

-[How Joints work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C03H_YZHuAI)  
-[Making a Scissor Joint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QisfRW0pd44)

While watching these videos, I felt that it was the perfect software to present my 'Automated Folding Furniture' and thus I decided to make and animate the Furniture using this software.
Since I had a conceptual drawing ready in sketchup, I already had my basic sizes and proportions in place. So I started making that in Fusion 360.

I started by making a wall which would anchor my furniture piece using **rectangle** command and then extruding using the **Extrude** command.
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/15.png" alt="Fusion 360" width="800px">

Next thing I had to do was making the anchor. Hence I created a **rectangle** on the wall and used the **presspull** command to extrude the anchor.
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/14.png" alt="Fusion 360" width="800px">

Now I had to give this anchor a pivot hole and give it shape. So, I first created a circle using **circle**, using presspull to remove that part from the anchor, and finally filleting the edges using **Fillet**.  
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/13.png" alt="Fusion 360" width="800px">

After this, I started modelling other moving parts of the folding chair. Again, I created the cuboidal member using **rectangle** and extruding it using the **Extrude** command.  
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/12.png" alt="Fusion 360" width="800px">

Then drawing **rectangle** on its face and using **presspull** to extrude it out.  
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/11.png" alt="Fusion 360" width="800px">

Next, use the **Fillet** command to fillet the edges of the member.
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/10.png" alt="Fusion 360" width="800px">

And then adding the pivot holes by drawing **circle** on the surface and using **presspull** to ceate voids.  
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/9.png" alt="Fusion 360" width="800px">

Use the same commands to add details on the other side of the member.  
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/8.png" alt="Fusion 360" width="800px">

Now, make the second member and use similar command to add details.  
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/7.png" alt="Fusion 360" width="800px">

Once the two member are made, we can use **mirror* command to make the other two members.  
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/6.png" alt="Fusion 360" width="800px">

It's time to start assembling. Go to **Joint** command under Assemble menu, and select the pivot points.(Note: The member you select first will move to the member you select second)  
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/5.png" alt="Fusion 360" width="800px">

The small cyan coloured thing will indicate the joint. We can select that to move the joint.  
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/4.png" alt="Fusion 360" width="800px">

Do the same process for the second member.  
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/3.png" alt="Fusion 360" width="800px">

And the other two.  
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/2.png" alt="Fusion 360" width="800px">

Once, all this is done, we can select one joint and rotate all of them should rotate.(This didnt work for me somehow even after multiple trials).

### Pros and Cons of Fusion 360

The Interface of the Fusion 360 is really clean. Though it takes time to get used to, the possibilities it offers are wide. But inspite of all this, since it is a cloud based software, exporting and importing files is a real hassle.

## **Inkscape** for 2d Vector

Having a little experience with Illustrator, getting used to inkscape was not a very difficult task.
After exploring commands a little, and looking at online tutorials, I decided to make a logo using the software.

Here, I've explained step by step how I made it.

1. I started by making a circle using the **circle** command on the left. 
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/Inkscape/1.PNG" alt="inkscape" width="800px">

2. Next I reduced the **opacity** of the circle from the Fill and Stroke toolbar on the right.
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/Inkscape/2.PNG" alt="inkscape" width="800px">

3. Then I duplicated the circle using **right click>duplicate**  
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/Inkscape/3.PNG" alt="inkscape" width="800px">

4. Next, change the proportions of the duplicate circle as shown in the image below using the eight **control points** that appear by clicking on the circle. Clicking oin the circle second will give options for rotation.  
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/Inkscape/4.PNG" alt="inkscape" width="800px">

5. Duplicate the ellipse as shown using **right click>duplicate**  
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/Inkscape/5.PNG" alt="inkscape" width="800px">

6. Select both the ellipses using shift key, and from **path>union** make a union of the two ellipses.  
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/Inkscape/6.png" alt="inkscape" width="800px">

7. Next, using the **align and distribute** toolbar on the right, arrange the circle and ellipses in perfect symmetry as shown.
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/Inkscape/7.png" alt="inkscape" width="800px">

8. Select the grey circle, then the red ellipses and go to **Path>difference** to get a 's' like shape as shown. 
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/Inkscape/8.png" alt="inkscape" width="800px">

9. Using **right click>duplicate** make a copy of the shape and reduce its size by pressing ctrl and shift so it doesnt lose it proportions or symmetry.
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/Inkscape/9.png" alt="inkscape" width="800px">

10. Using **Bezier Curve** tool on the left toolbar, select the white areas as shown below.
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/Inkscape/10.png" alt="inkscape" width="800px">

11. Next, **Using Path>Union** make a union of all the four curves and the smaller 's' form.
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/Inkscape/12.png" alt="inkscape" width="800px">

12. This is how the vector graphic should look like at this stage.  
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/Inkscape/13.png" alt="inkscape" width="800px">

13. Now, **change the opacity** of the shapes to zero using the slider on **Fill and Stroke** toolbar to make it opaque.  
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/Inkscape/14.png" alt="inkscape" width="800px">

14. Create another circle on the vector as shown.  
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/Inkscape/15.png" alt="inkscape" width="800px">

15. Now, send this circle below the 's' graphic by pressing on **Lower Selection to bottom** on the toolbar at the top. Also, align this circle with the corners of the red shape as shown below.  
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/Inkscape/16.png" alt="inkscape" width="800px">

16. Select the outer circle, go to **Gradient Tool** on the left toolbar and from **Fill and stroke** select **Radial**.
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/Inkscape/17.png" alt="inkscape" width="800px">

17. Increase the opacity of this Gradient to zero using **Alpha Opacity** in **Fill and Stroke** Toolbar.  
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/Inkscape/18.png" alt="inkscape" width="800px">

18. Left click on the x-y axis lines on the graphic to add **control points**.  
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/Inkscape/19.png" alt="inkscape" width="800px">

19. Change the colours of each of these control points using the sliders in **Fill and Stroke** toolbar.  
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/Inkscape/20.png" alt="inkscape" width="800px">

20. Do the same process with the blue circle under the 's' graphic.
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/Inkscape/21.png" alt="inkscape" width="800px">

21. Again create a duplicate of the 's' graphic.  
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/Inkscape/22.png" alt="inkscape" width="800px">

22. Flip this duplicate using **Flip selected oblect vertically** on the top Toolbar.
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/Inkscape/23.png" alt="inkscape" width="800px">

23. Place it below out graphic and add a linear gradient to create a **drop shadow** effect
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/Inkscape/24.png" alt="inkscape" width="800px">

24. And we now have our final Graphic!  
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/Inkscape/25.png" alt="inkscape" width="800px">

### Pros and Cons of Inkscape

The biggest advantage of Inkscape is that it free and still almost as powerful as Illustrator. Once you get used to the interface, you can pretty much create any 2d artwork.

## OnShape

On discussing with Local Guide at FabLabCEPT, he suggested me to try Onshape since my project is assembly based. Hence I decided to give that a try. Due to lack of time I was not able to make complete model of 
my furniture in onshape but I made a working pivot joint like the one I'm using for my Final Project.

1. Start by going to sketch option and **selecting the plane** you want to sketch in.  
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/Onshape/1.png" alt="onshape" width="800px">

2. I then drew the cross sectional rectangle using **corner rectangle** command under sketch.  
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/Onshape/2.png" alt="onshape" width="800px">

3. Use the extrude command to make the member of the assembly.  
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/Onshape/3.png" alt="onshape" width="800px">

4. Now, draw another rectangle for the area to be projected out for the joint.  
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/Onshape/4.png" alt="onshape" width="800px">

5. Again use the extrude command to make that part of the solid.  
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/Onshape/5.png" alt="onshape" width="800px">

6. Also fillet the edges of this extruded part as required using **Fillet Edges**.  
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/Onshape/7.png" alt="onshape" width="800px">

7. Now draw a **circle** from sketch menu on the plane where the pivot needs to be inserted.  
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/Onshape/8.png" alt="onshape" width="800px">

8. Use the **hole** command to create the void.  
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/Onshape/9.png" alt="onshape" width="800px">

9. Duplicate the member from **copy** option that appears on right clicking the part name in parts.  
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/Onshape/10.png" alt="onshape" width="800px">

10. Rotate the copy 180 on z-axis from the **rotate** option in the transform menu.  
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/Onshape/11.png" alt="onshape" width="800px">

11. Now mate connecters need to be added for the software to know which points to connect in the assembly. For this, select **Mate Connectors** and select the pivot points of both the parts.  
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/Onshape/13.png" alt="onshape" width="800px">

12. Once all this is done, go to **Assembly studio** option from parts studio and **insert** the parts that needs to be assembled.  
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/Onshape/12.png" alt="onshape" width="800px">

13. Go to **revolute** and select both the parts. The parts will come together and form the Assembly.  
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/Onshape/14.png" alt="onshape" width="800px">

14. When you click on the mate connector, you can see a curved slider to rotate the Joint.  
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week03/Onshape/15.png" alt="onshape" width="800px">

### Pros and cons of Onshape

The good thing about this software is it works really well for assemblies. You can create simple machine parts, and assemble it with the motion. But other than that, the interface of other 
CAD softwares is better and easier to understand. Also, Importing and exporting is an issue since it works on an online platform.
