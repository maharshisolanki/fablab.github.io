# 05. Electronics Production

From not knowing what a PCB is, to making one; this week has been about exploring a completely new territory. 
Hence, I'll start from basics and expain everything electronics from basics, including the new terms I learned this week.

The **goal** of this week was to:

- Make an in-circuit programmer using milling.
- Optionally try doing the same using the plotter machine.
- Learn identifying and soldering the parts and components onto that PCB.
- Programme the PCB(FabISP).
- (Group)Characterize the specifications of your PCB production process.

### What is a PCB?

A printed circuit board(PCB) mechanically supports and electrically connects electronic components or electrical components using 
conductive tracks, pads and other features etched from one or more sheet layers of copper laminated onto and/or between sheet layers of a non-conductive substrate. 
Components are generally soldered onto the PCB to both electrically connect and mechanically fasten them to it.  
Printed circuit boards are used in all but the simplest electronic products.

### Identifying Electronic Components of a PCB

All electronic devices comprise of several different parts. These parts work together to modify and manage current and voltage to produce the desired effect. 
PCB's act as backbones keeping everything connected and compacted in a form that is easy to use.

**Circuit Boards** : The circuit boards themselves are simple enough. They are just thin, plastic, rectangular plates with layer/layers of conductive copper foil on one or both sides. 
This copper is etched using milling or plotter machine after designing it as per one's requirements.

If the copper traces behave like the skeleton of the PCB, acting as its basic structure – then the components are the vital organs. Each one has a different function. 
They give the circuit the unique qualities that make it fit for its intended purpose. Depending on the device or electronic item a PCB is designed for, different 
components will be needed for different circuits. 

These components can consist of a wide range of electronic parts.

**Battery** : Provides the voltage to the circuit.

**Resistors** : Controls the electric current as it passes through them. They’re colour coded to determine their value.

### Mounting components on a Printed Circuit Board(PCB)

These components can be mounted on a circuit board using one of the below methods:

1. Surface-mount technology : This is a method for producing electronic circuits in which the components are mounted or placed directly onto the surface of 
printed circuit boards (PCBs). An electronic device so made is called a surface-mount device (SMD).  
An SMT component is usually smaller than its through-hole counterpart because it has either smaller leads or no leads at all. It may have short pins or leads of various styles, 
flat contacts, a matrix of solder balls (BGAs), or terminations on the body of the component.

2. Through-hole technology : This refers to the mounting scheme used for electronic components that involves the use of leads on the components that are inserted into 
holes drilled in printed circuit boards (PCB) and soldered to pads on the opposite side either by manual assembly (hand placement) or by the use of automated insertion 
mount machines. Through-hole components are best used for high-reliability products that require stronger connections between layers. Whereas SMT components are secured 
only by solder on the surface of the board, through-hole component leads run through the board, allowing the components to withstand more environmental stress. 
This is why through-hole technology is commonly used in military and aerospace products that may experience extreme accelerations, collisions, or high temperatures.

Both technologies can be used on the same board for components not suited to surface mounting such as large transformers and heat-sinked power semiconductors.

### Soldering

Soldering is one of the most fundamental skill needed to dabble in the world of electronics.

Solder, as a word, can be used in two different ways. 
Solder, the noun, refers to the alloy (a substance composed of two or more metals) that typically comes as a long, thin wire in spools or tubes. 
Solder, the verb, means to join together two pieces of metal in what is called a solder joint. So, we solder with solder!

Though, even after reading tutorials and watching videos, soldering is a skill that one needs to practice in order to master. No, arstist became one by watching others paint!

### Making a FabISP

##### What is a FabISP?

The FabISP is an in-system programmer for AVR microcontrollers, designed for production within a FabLab. 
That is, it allows you to program the microcontrollers on other boards you make, using nothing but a USB cable and 6-pin IDC to 6-pin IDC cable.

[FabISP](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/content/archive/projects/fabisp/)

Over the years, there have been various versions of the FabISP and the one I've used is ATtiny45.

[How to build a FabTinyISP](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.16/doc/projects/ftsmin/index.html)

### Getting your PCB ready

This is the first step in making your circuit board. There are more than one ways to achieve this:

**1. Using Milling Machine**

<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week05/IMG_0798e.jpg" alt="pcb" width="400px">

This is the easier and more commonly used method for making your base circuit board. To start with you need seperate *png* files for you traces and outline of the board. 
These can be downloaded here:

[Traces](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.16/doc/projects/ftsmin/fts_mini_traces.png)  
<img src="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.16/doc/projects/ftsmin/fts_mini_traces.png" alt="pcb" width="400px">

[Outline](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.16/doc/projects/ftsmin/fts_mini_cut.png)  
<img src="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.16/doc/projects/ftsmin/fts_mini_cut.png" alt="pcb" width="400px">

- First thing we need to do is tape the back side of the copper board using a double sided tape in a way 
so that no part of the surface is without tape and also, there is no overlapping of the tapes.  
Once this is done, remove the other surface of the tape and stick it on the levelled surface of the sacrificial board of the milling machine.

<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week05/IMG_0889e.jpg" alt="pcb" width="400px">

- Next is inserting a 1/64 drill bit into the machine. This is a very delicate tool and can break easily hence it must be used very carefully.  
Once the bit is tightened in the machine, bring it down the z-axis using the up and down buttons on the machine. Once the bit is close to the copper board, 
loosen the bit and place it in a manner that its tip is resting on the copper board. This step needs to be done very carefully.  

<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week05/IMG_0890e.jpg" alt="pcb" width="400px">

- The x and y axis of the bit can be modified using fabmodules.

### Using Fab modules

The software used for milling is fabmodules which can be accessed from [fabmodules.org](fabmodules.org)  
Detailed instructions on installing fab modules can be found [here](https://github.com/FabModules/fabmodules-html5/wiki/How-to-install).

(Note: To install python, enter *sudo apt install python pip*)

- Once fab modules is installled, go to terminal, and enter the following commands:  
cd desktop  
cd fabmodules  
This will take you to the root directory where fab modules is installed.

- Next, enter **npn start** in terminal which is a command for connecting the server to the machine.

<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week05/s12.jpg" alt="pcb" width="600px">

Once connected, go back to fabmodules.org where we'll be setting up the milling parameters.

- In Input Format, select **image(.png)** and from the pop-up window select the png file for traces of your PCB.

<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week05/s10.jpg" alt="pcb" width="600px">

- In Output format, select **Roland Mill(.rml)**.

<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week05/s3.jpg" alt="pcb" width="600px">

- Select **PCB Traces(1:64)**

<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week05/s16.jpg" alt="pcb" width="600px">

- Next is selcting the machine. It was MDX-20 in our case.

Once this is done, our file is set with the default output parameters.

**Note**: Confirm the size of the PCB before proceeding further because with png format, it tends to change the scale when certain changes are made.
(It blew up to almost 10 times the size it should be when I tried to rotate it by 90 degrees)

<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week05/s17.jpg" alt="pcb" width="600px">

- The output parameters I used are:
Cut Depth : 0.1mm  
Tool Diameter : 0.4  
Number of offsets : 4  
Offset overlapping : 50%  

Once this is set, click on **calculate** and the computer should display the complete path of the milling process.  
Click on **save** to save the project and **send** to start the milling.

<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week05/s2.jpg" alt="pcb" width="600px">

- The milling process should take a few minutes depending on the size of your pcb. The total time and the elapsed time is displayed on the computer screen.

<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week05/s18.jpg" alt="pcb" width="600px">  
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week05/IMG_0796e.jpg" alt="pcb" width="600px">

- Next is cutting the PCB. For that select the cut file from image(.png) option. Output format is the same(.rml). And the bit is PCB Cutting 1/32.

<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week05/s19.jpg" alt="pcb" width="600px">

- For cutting, we need to increase the cut depth. I used the depth of 1.0mm.
 
- Change the bit to 1/16 and all other process remains the same. The imporatnt thing here is to **not change the x and y**.
 
- Click on send and the machine should cut the PCB. Press **view** on the machine to bring the base plate to the front and carefully remove your cut PCB. The resultant boards should look something like this.

2. Using Plotter Machine

An optional method is using the plotting machine to cut the PCB on a copper roll.  
Steps to use this machine is shown on [week 4](http://fabacademy.org/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/#assignments/04.%20Computer%20Controlled%20Cutting/) documentation.

But, cutting on copper is bit more difficult than cutting vinyl. Even after getting a perfect test cut, because of the size of the pcb, 
the output cut was not coming satisfactory at all.

<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week05/IMG_0825e.jpg" alt="pcb" width="600px">
<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week05/IMG_0828e.jpg" alt="pcb" width="600px">

Hence, after a few trials, a double pass had to be done with pen pressure of *110gf* in order to get better results.

<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week05/IMG_0829e.jpg" alt="pcb" width="600px">

Once the Circuit is cut on copper, stick it on a piece of acrylic cut in laser machine using the outline file for the PCB as shown.

<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week05/IMG_0852e.jpg" alt="pcb" width="600px">

(Note : Transferring copper is very difficult since it stickes to the transfer tape better than it stickes to the acrylic surface. 
Hence, transferring the acrylic on a double sided tape is advisable brfore cutting it on the plotter machine)

### Gathering the components

Before starting the week's work, all the students collectively worked and organised all the components in compartmentalised boxes and labelled them. 
Hence, collecting the components for the PCB was a cake-walk.

<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week05/IMG_08053.jpg" alt="pcb" width="600px">

The components used in FabISP are:

- ATtiny 45 X 1
- 1 kΩ resistor X 2
- 499 Ω resistor X 2
- 49 Ω resistor X 2
- 100 nF X 1
- 3.3 V zener diode X 1
- Green LED X 1
- Red LED X 1

### Hands-on soldering

This was the most exciting task of the week. After a demo from Samuel Hoque, a fellow FabAcademy student with a background in electronics, 
I started soldering the components onto the surface of the PCB. 

<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week05/TFIW4339e.jpg" alt="pcb" width="600px">

It was particularly difficult to place the tiny components on place at first but I started to get a hang of it towards the end of the week.

<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week05/IMG_0871e.jpg" alt="pcb" width="600px">

This is how my first circuit looked like. Though, it's no where near to perfect, it did the job it was built for!

<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week05/IMG_0820e.jpg" alt="pcb" width="600px">

The connections were tested using the multimeter, as shown below. If the circuit is shorted at any point, the multimeter buzzer would make a sound. Fortunately, it was not and the circuit worked.

### Programming the ISP

This was another part of the week which was difficult to understand. The below link is where I started with to understand programming the ATtiny45.

[Programming the FabISP](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.16/doc/projects/ftsmin/index.html)

Since I had linux already running as a virtual OS, I used the below commands by following the tutorial on the below mentioned link.  

sudo apt-get update  
sudo apt-get upgrade all  
sudo apt-get install GCC-avr binutils-avr avr-libc  
sudo apt-get install gdb-avr  
sudo apt-get install avrdude  

[Installing gcc-avr](http://maxembedded.com/2015/06/setting-up-avr-gcc-toolchain-on-linux-and-mac-os-x/)

<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week05/11.jpg" alt="pcb" width="600px">

Once, this is set up, next thing we need to do is download the firmware to program the ISP.  
Use the link below.

http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.16/doc/projects/ftsmin/fts_firmware_bdm_v1.zip

Once this is downloaded, extract the zip folder at a location(I extracted it on desktop).
Now go to terminal, and change the directory to this folder.

cd ~/Desktop
cd ~/fts_firmware_bdm_v1

<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week05/112.jpg" alt="pcb" width="600px">

Once in the directory, connect the ISP to the computer using a programmer. Plugged one end to the USB and the other on the header.  
Green Light: means that the header is soldered correctly, the board is getting power.  
Yellow Light: means that the board is getting power, but most likely the 6-pin programming header is not soldered correctly (re-flow your solder joints / check for cold joints, check for shorts).
Red Light: means that the board is not getting power - check for shorts.  

<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week05/1ab.jpg" alt="pcb" width="600px">

Now, in terminal, after navigating into the unzipped file, enter the below command. 

*make*

This will build the hex file that will get programmed onto the ATtiny45.

<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week05/113.jpg" alt="pcb" width="600px">

Now enter, *make flash*  
This will erase the target chip, and program its flash memory with the contents of the .hex file you built before.

<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week05/114.jpg" alt="pcb" width="600px">

and then, *make fuses*  
This will set up all of the fuses except the one that disables the reset pin.

<img src="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-thakker/raw/master/docs/images/week05/115.jpg" alt="pcb" width="600px">

Once finished, its time to check the ISP. For that, enter *lsusb*

And the result should have "Multiple Vendors USBtiny" device.
